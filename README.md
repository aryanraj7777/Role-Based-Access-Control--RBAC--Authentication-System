Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Authentication System
A Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, providing secure authentication, authorization, and user role management.
Features
User Authentication: Secure login and registration using JWT tokens.
Role-Based Authorization: Access control based on user roles (e.g., Admin, User, Moderator).
Role Management: Dynamic role creation with specific permissions.
Secure Practices: Implements secure password hashing and token-based authentication.
Scalability: Modular architecture for adding more features easily.
Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
Password Hashing: bcrypt

Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your system.
MongoDB server running locally or a MongoDB Atlas account.
Steps
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/RBAC-Authentication-System.git
cd RBAC-Authentication-System
Install Dependencies:


npm install
Set Up Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the root directory and add:


MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB Connection URI>
JWT_SECRET=<Your JWT Secret Key>
PORT=5000
Run the Application:


npm start
Access the API:

Server will start at http://localhost:5000.
Endpoints
Authentication
Register User

POST /api/auth/register
Request Body:

{
  "username": "aryan123",
  "email": "aryan@example.com",
  "password": "securePassword",
  "role": "User"
}
Response:

{
  "message": "User registered successfully"
}
Login User

POST /api/auth/login
Request Body:

{
  "email": "aryan@example.com",
  "password": "securePassword"
}
Response:

{
  "token": "JWT_TOKEN"
}
Role Management
Create Role
POST /api/roles
Requires Admin role.
Request Body:

{
  "name": "Admin",
  "permissions": ["CREATE_USER", "DELETE_USER", "READ_ALL_USERS"]
}
Response:

{
  "message": "Role created successfully"
}
Access-Controlled Endpoints
Implement endpoints to demonstrate role-based access control (e.g., Admin-only routes).
Testing
Use Postman or cURL to test endpoints.
Authenticate by passing the JWT token in the Authorization header:

Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>
Future Improvements
Add support for more granular permissions.
Implement email verification for user registration.
Integrate frontend with React or Angular for a complete application.
Add rate-limiting and advanced logging mechanisms.
